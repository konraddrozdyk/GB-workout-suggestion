# Workout Suggestions App

This is a React-based prototype application for suggesting workouts to users based on their preferences. The app uses **React**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **TanStack Router** for navigation. It features a simple two-page design:

1. A home page (`index`) where users select their preferences via dropdowns and click "Suggest".
2. A suggestions page that displays tailored workout suggestions based on the user's input.

- **Responsive Design:** Styled using Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive UI.
- **Modern Navigation:** Built with TanStack Router for flexible and modern routing.
- **No Backend:** Fully static app, focused on client-side logic.
